## Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- Use TypeScript for all agent code
- Leverage existing MCP infrastructure
- Build on top of current CI/CD pipeline
- Use ClickUp API v2 for ticket management

### Process Decisions
- Start with Slack as primary entry point
- Require human approval for first 100 fixes
- Limit to non-critical bugs initially
- Focus on single-file fixes first

### Open Questions
1. Should we use a message queue between agents?
2. How to handle multiple related bugs?
3. What's the escalation path for failed fixes?
4. How to manage agent versioning?
