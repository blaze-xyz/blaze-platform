## 🔧 Implementation Options

### Option 1: Direct Code Implementation
Build the orchestration layer directly in your codebase using TypeScript/Node.js. Best for teams wanting full control and customization.

**Pros:**
- Complete control over implementation
- Direct integration with existing code
- No additional infrastructure

**Cons:**
- More development effort
- Harder to modify workflows
- Custom monitoring needed

### Option 2: n8n Workflow Automation (Recommended)
Use [n8n](https://n8n.io) as the orchestration layer for visual workflow design and management.

**Pros:**
- Visual workflow builder
- Easy to modify without code changes
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Extensive integrations out of the box
- Self-hosted with full data control

**Cons:**
- Additional infrastructure to manage
- Learning curve for n8n

- **Sentry**: Error monitoring and bug detection

### Quality Assurance
- **CodeRabbit**: Automated code review
- **Jest**: Unit testing
- **Maestro**: E2E testing
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement

## 💰 Investment & ROI

### Implementation Cost
- **Development**: 8 weeks (2 senior engineers) - $40,000
- **Infrastructure**: $2,000/month additional
- **Agent Services**: $5,000/month
- **Total Initial**: ~$50,000

### Expected Annual Savings
- **Developer Time**: 40 hours/week saved

- **Quality Improvement**: 50% fewer production bugs
- **Estimated ROI**: $400,000+ annually

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to Claude Code or Devin
- GitHub repository with existing CI/CD
- Porter/Render deployment setup
- Sentry error monitoring

### Quick Start
1. Review the [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)
2. Set up core infrastructure (Week 1-2)
3. Deploy feature workflow (Week 3-4)
4. Implement bug fixing (Week 5-6)
5. Add advanced features (Week 7-8)

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Development Velocity

## 🎨 Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Example
```yaml
# Feature spec in docs/features/payment-links-v2.md
1. Product Manager creates detailed spec
2. Command: `blaze agent feature --spec=payment-links-v2.md`
3. Agent creates feature branch and implements
4. PR automatically created with tests
5. CodeRabbit reviews and approves
6. Porter deploys test environment
7. QA validates against spec
8. Auto-merge and deploy to production
```

### Bug Fixing Example
```yaml
# Sentry alert for payment failure
1. Sentry detects 5xx errors in payment flow
2. Agent analyzes stack trace and recent changes
3. Identifies root cause in validation logic
4. Generates minimal fix with tests
5. Creates hotfix PR with emergency approval
6. Deploys to production within 2 hours
7. Monitors for regression
```
