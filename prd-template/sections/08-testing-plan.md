## Testing Plan

### Testing Strategy Overview
- **Test Coverage Target**: 90% for new code, 80% overall
- **Testing Environments**: Local, Staging, Production (smoke tests only)
- **Testing Tools**: Jest, Supertest, Cypress, K6

### Unit Testing

#### CoinflowACHService
**Coverage Target**: 95%  
**Key Test Cases**:
- [ ] Create bank payment method with valid Plaid token
- [ ] Handle invalid Plaid token gracefully
- [ ] Initiate ACH deposit within limits
- [ ] Reject deposits exceeding limits
- [ ] Process webhook with valid signature
- [ ] Reject webhook with invalid signature

**Edge Cases**:
- [ ] Deposit amount exactly at minimum ($10)
- [ ] Deposit amount exactly at maximum ($25,000)
- [ ] Multiple concurrent deposits from same user
- [ ] Webhook received out of order

**Mocking Requirements**:
- Coinflow API responses
- Plaid API responses
- Database operations
- Queue operations

### Integration Testing

#### ACH Deposit Flow
**Test Scenario**: Complete ACH deposit from initiation to completion  
**Dependencies**: CoinflowAPI, Database, Queue, NotificationService  
**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Happy path: $100 deposit completes successfully
- [ ] Error handling: API returns 400 error
- [ ] Timeout scenarios: API doesn't respond within 30s
- [ ] Webhook processing: Status updates processed correctly

**Test Data Requirements**:
- Test user with verified account
- Test bank account (Plaid sandbox)
- Coinflow sandbox credentials

### End-to-End Testing

#### Complete ACH Deposit Flow
**Description**: User adds bank account and completes ACH deposit  
**Prerequisites**: 
- User logged in with verified account
- Plaid sandbox configured
- Coinflow sandbox configured

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Payment Methods → See "Add Bank Account" option
2. Click "Add Bank Account" → Plaid Link opens
3. Complete Plaid flow → Bank account appears in list
4. Navigate to Deposit → Select ACH option
5. Enter $100 → See estimated arrival date
6. Confirm deposit → See success message
7. Check transaction history → See pending ACH deposit
8. Trigger webhook (sandbox) → Status updates to completed
9. Check wallet → USDC balance increased by $100

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Deposit completes in < 5 minutes (sandbox)
- [ ] All status updates reflected in UI
- [ ] Email notifications received
- [ ] Analytics events fired correctly

### Manual Testing

#### Test Case: ACH Deposit Limits
**Priority**: Critical  
**Preconditions**: User with connected bank account  
**Test Steps**:
1. Enter $9 → See error "Minimum deposit is $10"
2. Enter $10 → Proceed button enabled
3. Enter $25,001 → See error "Maximum deposit is $25,000"
4. Enter $25,000 → Proceed button enabled
5. Complete $10,000 deposit → Success
6. Attempt another $45,000 → See error "Daily limit exceeded"

**Test Data**:
- Valid inputs: $10, $100, $1000, $25000
- Invalid inputs: $9, $25001, $0, -$100, "abc"
- Boundary values: $10.00, $25000.00

### Performance Testing

#### ACH Deposit Load Test
**Type**: Load Test  
**Target Metrics**:
- Response time: p95 < 3 seconds
- Throughput: 100 deposits/minute
- Error rate: < 0.1%

**Test Scenario**:
- Load pattern: Ramp up to 100 concurrent users over 5 minutes
- Duration: 30 minutes sustained load
- Success criteria: All metrics maintained under load

### Security Testing
- [ ] Attempt to modify another user's bank account
- [ ] Try to initiate deposit from unowned bank account
- [ ] Submit malformed webhook payloads
- [ ] Attempt SQL injection in amount field
- [ ] Test rate limiting on deposit endpoint

### Regression Testing
**Critical Paths to Verify**:
- [ ] Card deposits still function correctly
- [ ] Existing payment method list displays properly
- [ ] Transaction history shows all payment types
- [ ] Fee calculations remain accurate

### Test Environment Requirements
- **Backend**: 
  - Spark API with ACH feature flag enabled
  - PostgreSQL with test data
  - Redis for queues
- **External Services**:
  - Plaid sandbox account with test credentials
  - Coinflow sandbox with ACH enabled
  - SMTP test server for emails
- **Test Data**:
  - 10 test users with various account states
  - Test bank accounts in Plaid sandbox
  - Webhook simulation tools
```

### Best Practices:
1. **Automate repetitive tests**: Focus manual testing on exploratory scenarios
2. **Test early and often**: Don't wait for feature completion
3. **Document test results**: Keep records for compliance
4. **Use realistic data**: Test with production-like volumes
5. **Test failure scenarios**: Don't just test the happy path
6. **Verify logging**: Ensure errors are logged appropriately
