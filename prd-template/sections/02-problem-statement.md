## Problem Statement

### Current State
Users can only deposit funds using debit/credit cards, which limits deposit amounts and incurs high processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction).

### Pain Points
1. **High Transaction Costs**: Card processing fees significantly reduce profit margins on deposits
2. **Low Deposit Limits**: Card limits ($5,000) prevent users from making larger investments
3. **Payment Failures**: 15% of card transactions fail due to bank restrictions on crypto purchases

### User Impact
- **For High-Value Users**: Cannot deposit desired amounts in single transactions
- **For Cost-Conscious Users**: Pay excessive fees that reduce their investment capital
- **For Traditional Finance Users**: Uncomfortable with card payments for large amounts

### Business Impact
- **Lost Revenue**: $2.4M annually in processing fees
- **Operational Costs**: Support team handles 500+ tickets/month for payment issues
- **Market Position**: Competitors offering ACH have 40% higher average deposit values

### Why Now?
- Coinflow now offers ACH integration
- User demand has increased 300% based on support requests
- Regulatory clarity makes ACH for crypto more viable
