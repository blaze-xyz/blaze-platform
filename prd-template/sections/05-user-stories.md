### Best Practices:
1. **Focus on value**: Always include the "so that" to clarify the benefit
2. **Be specific**: Avoid vague terms like "easy" or "quick"
3. **Independent**: Each story should deliver value on its own
4. **Testable**: Acceptance criteria must be verifiable
5. **Sized appropriately**: Break large stories into smaller ones
6. **Include edge cases**: Don't just focus on the happy path
